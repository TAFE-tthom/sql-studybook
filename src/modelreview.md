# Review

Database modelling, design and normalisation is part of application development and crafting. These techniques are useful when mapping out the data model for an application and how the application would best benefit from its design.

* What you should know and understand
  * Different ERDs and design granularity (conceptual, logical, physical)
  * Purpose of each ERD and cardinality connections between entities
  * Understand the different normalisation forms and their criteria  * Understand the different normalisation methods

* What you should be able to apply
  * Construct different ERDs such as a conceptual, logical and physical ERD
  * Construct a Crow's Foot ERD
  * Construct a Chen's Notation ERD
  * Perform normalisation on a database from 0 to 4NF.
