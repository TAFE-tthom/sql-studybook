Generally, this book is fairly brief and takes a lot of content from slides that I use to deliver. However there are chapters are currently unfinished, these include the following.

* Users, Roles and Security
* Database Modelling and Normalisation
* Exercises
* Review
* Conclusion

These will be worked on over time, however this is in a reasonable state to be used with the current software.
