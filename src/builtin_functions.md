# Builtin Functions and Operators

Within this chapter we will be covering operators and how they work with different data types and clauses along with functions and how they are mixed in with SQL queries.

SQL boasts a large amount of features that helps support your queries and processing of data. The SQL language has a standard that vendors implement/comply with. However, some functions that are accessible for one vendor may not be accessible for another so please ensure you refer to your vendor's documentation.

The topic areas of this chapter will include.

* Common Operators and Data Types
