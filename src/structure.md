# Structure

The book has been developed to facilitate active learning. There is a mixture of iconography associated with the same icons in the **Preparaton** introduction, sections for exercises and review.

As the author, it is my hope to encourage engagement with the topic beyond simply reading the words in this book.

## What to look for

Through out the book, you will see the following icons appears that you saw earlier. These are associated with activities that you should probably do. While the actual outcome from it may be unclear, it acts as a hint for the reader that section being read is **important** and this **activity** should be undertaken.

As a guide, when you see the following icons, you can assume the following.

* 📒 - Note down the information or review your notes
* 🖊️ - Sketch a solution or write down ideas
* 🕙 - Indication of time to be spent, outlines the time constraints
* 📅 - Plan out your sessions with the information provided
* 💻 - Set up to code and work on exercises


## Activity Sections

Through out the book, certain sections will be clearly marked for an activity. These will include:

* Exercises - Normally, these are coding exercises but may be design exercises
* Research - You will be given questions that will require research to answer
* Quiz - A set of question that you can quickly answer with existing knowledge
* Reflection - Prompting you to review your solution or methods

These sections are to ensure you build up skills by reading, doing and reviewing.
