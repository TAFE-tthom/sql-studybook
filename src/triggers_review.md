Views and Triggers can seem like opposing concepts but they have clear relevance as they are both DDL constructs and serve a particular role as a meta-construct. Views are constructs that can be readily leveraged by caching systems and usable as a summary. Triggers are a mechanism to respond to an event on a database object that can impacts other objects and data.

* What you should know and understand
  * What a view and trigger is and how they relate to tables
  * Suitable scenarios for a view
  * Suitable scenarios for a trigger
  * Different response timings for a trigger
  * Insertion rules on a view

* What you should be able to apply
  * Construct a view that can create a suitable summary for a table (or multiple tables)
  * Create a trigger that will respond to an insertion, update or delete event before or after the action has finished
  * Be able to insert data on a view which maps to a single table
