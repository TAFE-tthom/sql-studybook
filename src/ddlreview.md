# Review

By the end of your first significant chapter of SQL, you should have acquired a reasonable start on the DDL part of **SQL**. This beginning starts to shape how the data will be modelled and held within a database and its connectivity.

* What you should know and understand
  * Basics of a SQL Query
  * A Database Schema
  * How tables can relate to others
  * Altering tables and columns
  * Primary and Foreign keys

* What you should be able to apply
  * Create simple tables that will relate to each other
  * Create a simple database
  * Insert data and query it

Review the above dot-points every after every chapter and make sure you reinforce your understanding and skills by applying them and practicing.
