# Joins and Set Operations

Within this chapter, we will be leveraging a feature that will allow us to combine tables and match them on particular fields. We will be discussing and demonstrating joins and go through the following topic areas.

1. Using Multiple Tables
2. Caresian Product 
3. Inner Join
4. Left Join & Right Join
5. Full Joins
6. Unions, Intersect and Difference

These constructs are quite power and allow us to perform queries without naively assuming that the construction is a cartesian product.
