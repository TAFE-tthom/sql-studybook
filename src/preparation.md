# Preparation

It is assumed you have a Computer 💻, you should make sure you have access to it

Prior to starting, it is advised you also have the following.

* Notebook 📒
* Pen/Pencil 🖊️ 
* Time Keeping Device 🕙 - (Clock, Watch, Phone)
* Planner 📅 - (Calendar)

The utility of the above is to incorporate tools and learning habits. The icons used will be leveraged throughout the book to indicate where it is appropriate to use a tool.

However, after some time, this will become natural 

## Setting up to study and work 💻

Most GUIs and Code editors have the ability to have window tiling. While this is a personal choice, I would recommend at at least having half the screen dedicated to code and a terminal window and the other half for documentation and this book.

This setup should give you a suitable and focused workspace.


## Constructing Solutions 📒 🖊️
 
Writing code is mostly the act of putting an idea onto paper. These ideas are ones in which we need to process and visualise.

The **Notebook** is a powerful tool here, to illustrate this point, it can be used for:

* Using squares and lines to represent the relationship between objects in code.
* Writing out the steps of an algorithm you are designing and then implementing it.
* Showing the relationship between function calls.
* Creating notes and a summary of the task at hand and what to focus on.
* A deconstruction of the problem into smaller pieces.

The above examples are skills you will need to develop to improve as a programmer and problem solver.

For your own self, it also helps to ease the cognitive load when you are constructing a solution. Any complex problem is going to require a lot of notes and information being accessible and there is going to be a limit on what you can hold in your head and memorise.

## Knowing what you have done 📒

In combination with the notebook, A journal helps keep track of what solutions you have tried, what you still are attempting to resolve and gives you a points of reflection.

Software projects can require us to take on different tasks at different points in time and remembering where we were at can be difficult.

Journaling what we have done and where we left off, gives us a way to return back to where we left something, what has been completed and the reasons why. It also provides accountability.

When a study or coding session concludes, make sure you make notes on what needs to be worked on and what you need to do to continue.
 

## Scheduling Sessions 📅 🕙

Small and large projects will have multiple parts to them. These aren't necessarily solvable within a day or even within a week or month.

Planning is crucial to ensure that you schedule tasks to work on a schedule.

As an outcome, aim to do the following

* Schedule days of the week that are appropriate times to study or code 📅
  * Ideally, try not to study or code when tired - This will be difficult
  * Don't overstretch yourself, you work better when you have rested

* Have a clear session length 🕙
  * Dedicate roughly between 2-4 hours per a session
  * When starting, having a fixed length of time  

* Construct a plan for completing the book 📅🕙
  * Treat each chapter as requiring 10 hours, some may take less time or more time.
  * With this knowledge, you at least know what you will have achieved and how much more time you need to put in to achieve the rest.

Don't be afraid of shifting it and changing the schedule it does not need to be rigid or super strict but has to communicate what you are working on in a way that helps you understand when you get back to it.

## Always Remember!

Each time you go into a study session, make sure you have all the equipment and do a quick preflight check-list.

* Laptop is open and windows are tiled with a code editor and documentation open
* Notebook is open to the last page you used with a blank page available
* Pen is ready for drawing up solutions and noting ideas
* Catch up on any information or notes you left for yourself from last session
* Resume from where you left off

This can help with optimising the time you have with your studying and coding sessions.
