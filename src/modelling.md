# Database Modelling and Normalisation

As part of requirements gathering, your job will be to understand how you are able to structure the data outlined in the requirements.

As part of development, you will need process documentation and map real-world problems to software. This includes how you will represent the data in the data base.

Throughout the book you have been making schemas through code itself. Within this chapter we will be focused on database design and modelling. This will include Entity Relationship Diagrams and Normalisation.

This chapter will go through the following topic areas.

* Database Modelling
* Entity Relationship Diagrams (Chen Notation and Crow's Foot Notation)
* Database Normalisation
