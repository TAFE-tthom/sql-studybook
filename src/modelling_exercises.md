## Tasks

### 1. Conceptual Diagram (Book Store)

Books4All is an e-commerce business that sells and delivers books to customers. The business will accept new releases from publishers and independents.

Customers will access the platform via their web browser and be able to select and purchase books on their platform. The book itself can be in hardback, softcover or digital.

Purchases are made through a cart system and then moved to the checkout. If the purchases are strictly digital then an address is not needed with the account. A customer can make many orders at different times, some will have different fulfillment/completion dates.

Create a conceptual diagram using appropriate software. Alternatively, you can construct this on paper.

### 2. Logical Diagram (Book Store)

Double check your conceptual diagram and discuss if it meets the criteria that the client has outlined. Afterwards you will need to build a logical diagram for the book store.

Start filling out the details of your diagram by providing details to the entities. You should do the fulling for the entities.

* A book has a ISBN, title, author, publisher. There are additional details like genre and language that should/could be recorded with it.

* Customers must provide their full name and contact details such as email and mobile phone. Addresses are mandatory if a delivery is to be made directly to them. An address needs to include country, state, postcode, street/no and other details to clarify there it is to go.

* Orders will contain a quantity of the number of books being purchased.

### 3. Physical Diagram and Model (Book Store)

You will need to clarify the datatypes for each column from your logical diagram and ensure that the diagram itself could be used as a reference/implementation.

Implement the design within a database and ensure that can meet the use cases of the domain.
