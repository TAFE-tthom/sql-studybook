# Conclusion

Congratulations for reaching the end of the book. While this book is used in conjunction with the SQL challenge website, it is only the starting point for your journey into SQL but should provide enough experience and foundations to continue to build upon.

I do hope you have had a lot of fun going through each chapter and attempting the questions given. Being able to learn something completely new is always going to be a challenge but it is also very exciting and gives you a whole new skillset you didn't have before.

Good luck in the future with SQL and computers.
