# Indexes and Constraints

Within this chapter we will explore indexes and constraints. This follows on from the start of the book where we constructed primary and foreign keys. Indexes are a natural extension but can seem a little elusive and difficult to identify. As with indexes, we are able to apply rules within our schema to ensure that the schema adheres to the requirements of the domain. For example, we may want to ensure that for a website that is selling Alcohol, that anyone who is signing up is over the age of 18 (or whatever the law is for your state and/or country).

We will be examining the following topic areas.

* Indexes and Uniqueness
* Metadata associated with indexes
* Constraints and associating `CHECK`.
