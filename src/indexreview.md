# Review

As a natural extension of DDL, indexes and constraints play a crucial role for both performance but also for data integrity and implementing domain rulesets. Indexes and unique columns are leveraged to assist with searching data efficiently by being able to map it appropriately. Constraints allow the database to take on new rules to ensure the data integrity is meter and is consistent.

* What you should know and understand
  * What an index is and its relationship to primary and foreign keys
  * What a check constrain is and where it is appropriate to apply it
  * Unique indexes and what their limitations and uses are
  * Domain rules and how they relate to indexes and constraints

* What you should be able to apply
  * Create a unique index or index for speeding up searches
  * Create a check constraint that adheres to a domain rule
  * Ensure that data is consistent and matches the requirements
