# Users, Roles and Security


Database security is a significant component during development and deployment. We want to ensure data is secured and not openly accessible to all.

On top of this, we want to ensure we understand the permissions model that we can leverage within a database system.

There are different attack vectors and methods of securing a database.

1. Physical Security
2. Digital Security - Encryption and Hashing
3. Permissions and Roles - Assigning permissions for users and roles
4. Incident Responses - What to do in the case of a breach

Within this chapter we will exploring the following topic areas.

* Data Control Language and Permissions
* Users, Roles and Permissions
