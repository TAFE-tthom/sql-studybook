# DDL and Basics

This chapter will cover the basics of SQL and will, as part of necessity involve covering some DQL and DML basics as part of DDL. DDL (Data Definition Language) is a component of SQL as a whole and is focused on the construction of the schema.

Within this chapter we will be covering the following areas.

1. Structure of SQL Queries 
2. Creating databases (schemas)
3. Creating tables
4. Altering tables
5. Keys and Constraints
6. Removing tables


Some of the DQL and DML examples will be straight forward examples where we are inserting new data to demonstrate its construction and its querying it to demonstrate that we are able to retrieve data.
