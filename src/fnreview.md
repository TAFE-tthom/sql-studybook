# Review

At the end of this chapter we have started exposing some of the nice functions and built-ins that SQL provides. It should also provide insight into how programming languages are evaluated and the different operations and functions that have to occur.

* What you should know and understand
  * What a function is and the components of it
  * Parameters and return types
  * Body of a function
  * Appropriate usage of them and context
  * Operators and how they relate to functions

* What you should be able to apply
  * Use existing built-in functions for string manipulation
  * Use functions in a where clause and in a column
  * Use different operators for where clauses for fuzzy searching
  * Formatting the results of a query
